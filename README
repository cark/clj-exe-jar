clj-exe-jar

A sample executable jar build process for clojure

Dependencies : clojure.jar, clojure-contrib.jar, ant

Rationale:

Many clojure newcomers ask how to properly package their work for easy distribution.
It is my hope this will be a good starting point.

Included functionalities :

The sample project will produce an executable jar, as well as a zip file containing
both the executable jar and the supporting libraries. The run-clojure script is
a good way to start clojure with a simple class-path. To add more libraries, just 
throw these in the lib directory.

How to:

- a Test run : 
Run ant from the root directory of this project. No parameters are required.
After the ant build, you'll find a cara.sample.jar file in the output directory.
A cara.sample.zip file will also be created. the zip files includes all supporting libraries.

- Your own project :
Copy the sample directory to a folder named according to you project name.
In the src directory, create your code. You can have a look to src/cara/sample.clj for 
inspiration about creating your main class.
In the build.xml file, change the property "targetclass" to the genclass'ed namespace
containing your -main function.
from the project root, run ant with no parameters.

Shortcomings :

While not stricly necessary, the clojure-contrib.jar library is included.
